# A Contacts App

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to create a simple Contacts app that utilizes React to provide users with a streamlined and user-friendly experience for organizing and managing their contacts. To achieve this, I implemented a createCard function within a map function to display each contact.

I aimed to maximize efficiency by extracting essential components and functionalities into their respective components. As a result, I was able to break down the app into five distinct components, each of which can be repurposed as needed. However, coordinating the interactions between each component posed a considerable challenge. Fortunately, the React developer tools provided valuable assistance in maintaining the project's organization and structure.

While this project is currently completed, I plan to enhance it in the future by incorporating additional methods for adding and deleting contacts.

## What is DRY?
DRY is a software development principle that stands for “Don't Repeat Yourself.” Living by this principle means that your aim is to reduce repetitive patterns and duplicate code and logic in favor of modular and referenceable code. DRY code means you get to write duplicate code less often. You're saving lots of time writing the same thing over and over. Not only that, but you're saving your cognitive energy for bigger problems you'll end up needing to solve, instead of wasting that time and energy on tedious syntax.
