# A Contacts App

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to create a simple Contacts app that utilizes React to provide users with a streamlined and user-friendly experience for organizing and managing their contacts. To achieve this, I implemented a createCard function within a map function to display each contact.

I aimed to maximize efficiency by extracting essential components and functionalities into their respective components. As a result, I was able to break down the app into five distinct components, each of which can be repurposed as needed. However, coordinating the interactions between each component posed a considerable challenge. Fortunately, the React developer tools provided valuable assistance in maintaining the project's organization and structure.

While this project is currently completed, I plan to enhance it in the future by incorporating additional methods for adding and deleting contacts.
